# chatplayground-relay-worker

> OpenAI-compatible Cloudflare Worker that relays to [chatplayground.ai](https://web.chatplayground.ai/).
> BYOK, stateless, multi-model. Drop-in `base_url` for OpenAI SDKs, Chatbox, LangChain, etc.

## What it does

Wraps chatplayground.ai's internal chat endpoint as standard OpenAI
`/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/responses` APIs, so OpenAI-compatible clients
can use chatplayground's chat models with your existing chatplayground account.

```
OpenAI SDK ──► Cloudflare Worker ──► chatplayground.ai
              (this repo)            (your account)
```

No keys stored, no chat history persisted, no database. Just a translator.

## Status: experimental

chatplayground.ai does not publish a public API. This worker reverse-engineers
their internal endpoints. The following will break it (degrade gracefully
where possible):

- chatplayground changes endpoint paths or request shape
- chatplayground tightens authentication on their internal endpoint
- chatplayground changes the `/api/models` shape in a way that breaks discovery
  (falls back to a small SEED list on failure)

## Authentication: bring your own Clerk user ID

You provide your chatplayground Clerk user ID (looks like `user_xxxxxxxxxxxxx`)
as the OpenAI-style Bearer token. The worker forwards it to upstream as
`X-Clerk-User-Id`.

**How to find your Clerk user ID:**

1. Open <https://web.chatplayground.ai/> and sign in
2. Open DevTools → Network tab
3. Send any message in the UI
4. Find the request to `/api/chat/azure`
5. Copy the value of the `X-Clerk-User-Id` request header

> ⚠️ **Treat your Clerk user ID like an API key.**
> It grants access to your chatplayground account quota.
> Don't share it. Don't post your worker URL publicly without thinking.

### Optional: gateway mode (custom API key, hidden Clerk ID)

Passthrough mode hands your Clerk ID to every client. If you'd rather keep the
Clerk ID server-side and give callers a custom key you can rotate, set two
secrets:

```bash
wrangler secret put CLERK_USER_ID    # your real user_... identity
wrangler secret put RELAY_API_KEY    # a key you invent, e.g. sk-relay-xxxxx
```

Once `RELAY_API_KEY` is set, callers authenticate with **that** key
(`Authorization: Bearer sk-relay-xxxxx`) and the worker uses the stored
`CLERK_USER_ID` upstream — the real identity is never exposed. Unset the secret
to fall back to passthrough. (Secrets, not `wrangler.jsonc` vars — vars are
plaintext.)

## Features

| Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | Stream + non-stream; multimodal (`image_url` content parts) |
| `POST /v1/responses` | Responses API envelope; GPT-5.6-style input, streaming, and function-call items |
| `GET /v1/models` | Dynamic discovery from chatplayground's `/api/models`, KV + memory cached |
| `POST /v1/files` | Image upload proxy → returns a URL usable as `image_url.url` |

| Not supported | Why |
|---|---|
| Tool / function calling | Supported through the relay's structured prompt shim; native upstream tool execution is not available |
| `/v1/images/generations` | Upstream image-gen models live on a different endpoint |
| `/v1/embeddings` | Upstream doesn't expose embeddings |
| `/v1/audio/*` | Upstream doesn't expose audio |

### Chat models (auto-discovered)

chatplayground serves chat models from **three upstream endpoints**
(`azure` / `perplexity` / `lmsys`), routed by model `botId`. The relay mirrors
that routing automatically, so a single OpenAI `model` field reaches the right
one. It exposes **every chat-group model** in the feed — including models
chatplayground marks `active:false` (hidden in their UI but still callable
upstream, e.g. perplexity `sonar-pro`).

Some commonly-available ids (call `GET /v1/models` for the live set):

| Model id (use this in `model` field) | Provider | Endpoint | Vision |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gpt-5.5` | openai | azure | ✅ |
| `gpt-5.4` | openai | azure | ✅ |
| `gemini-3-flash` | google | azure | ✅ |
| `claude-haiku-4-5` | anthropic | azure | ✅ |
| `deepseek-v4-pro` | deepseek | azure | — |
| `kimi-k2.6` | moonshot | azure | — |
| `perplexity-sonar-pro` | perplexity | perplexity | — |
| `llama-4-scout` | meta | lmsys | ✅ |

> Perplexity models return a structured citation list at the end of the
> stream. The relay strips that raw payload and re-emits the URLs as a
> Markdown `**Sources**` block; on the non-streaming path it also rewrites
> inline `[N]` markers as Markdown links so they render as clickable in
> OpenAI-compatible chat clients.

## Quick start

### Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/chatplayground-relay-worker
cd chatplayground-relay-worker
npm install
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:8787
```

### Deploy to Cloudflare

```bash
npm run deploy
# → https://chatplayground-relay.<your-account>.workers.dev
```

### Optional: KV-backed model cache

Without KV, model discovery falls back to a 5-minute per-isolate memory cache
plus a hardcoded SEED fallback list. That's fine for personal use. For shared
deployments you can add KV:

```bash
npx wrangler kv namespace create MODEL_CACHE
# Then uncomment the kv_namespaces block in wrangler.jsonc and paste the printed ID.
```

## Usage

### curl

```bash
export WORKER=https://chatplayground-relay.<acct>.workers.dev
export KEY=user_YOUR_CLERK_ID

# List models
curl -s $WORKER/v1/models -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" | jq

# Non-streaming chat
curl -s $WORKER/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"model":"gpt-5.5","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"say hi"}]}' | jq

# Streaming
curl -N $WORKER/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"model":"gemini-3-flash","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"count to 5"}],"stream":true}'
```

### OpenAI Python SDK

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://chatplayground-relay.<acct>.workers.dev/v1",
    api_key="user_YOUR_CLERK_ID",
)

# Text
resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-5.5",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is use-after-free?"}],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)

# Streaming
for chunk in client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-5.5",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Count to 5"}],
    stream=True,
):
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="", flush=True)

# Responses API, including function tools
resp = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5.6",
    input="Find the latest status",
    tools=[{
        "type": "function",
        "name": "web_search",
        "description": "Search the web",
        "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"query": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["query"]},
    }],
)
print(resp.output_text)
# When the model requests a tool, inspect resp.output for type="function_call",
# execute it in your application, then send function_call_output in the next input.

# Vision — upload via /v1/files, then reference
file = client.files.create(file=open("photo.jpg", "rb"), purpose="vision")
resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gemini-3-flash",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?"},
            {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": file.id}},
        ],
    }],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Chatbox / desktop clients

Add a custom OpenAI-compatible provider:

- **API host / base URL**: `https://chatplayground-relay.<acct>.workers.dev/v1`
- **API key**: your `user_xxxxxxxx` Clerk ID
- **Model**: any id from `GET /v1/models`

### Continuing a chatplayground-side conversation

Every API call defaults to a fresh chatplayground chat with `noSave: true` —
nothing shows up in your chatplayground.ai dashboard, and each request starts
a new conversation on the upstream side. The conversation still works because
OpenAI clients re-send the full `messages[]` array every turn.

Two opt-in extension fields let you change that:

| If you want | Add to request body |
|---|---|
| Save to chatplayground history | `"metadata": {"save": true}` |
| Continue a specific chatplayground chat | `"user": "<chatId>"` (CUID from a prior chatplayground session) |

Standard OpenAI SDKs don't surface these but you can hand-craft the request.

### Model discovery

`/v1/models` doesn't hardcode a list. Each request goes through:

1. **In-isolate memory cache** (5 min TTL) — hits if isolate is warm
2. **KV cache** (1 h TTL) — hits across isolates if `MODEL_CACHE` binding is configured
3. **Live discovery** — `GET app.chatplayground.ai/api/models` (public JSON,
   no auth), validate each entry (`{botId, modelName, provider, group,
   endpoint, active}`), keep `group:"chat"`. The `active` flag is **not**
   filtered on — it controls UI visibility only; inactive models are still
   callable upstream. Each entry's `endpoint` field decides which of the three
   `/api/chat/*` upstreams serves it.
4. **SEED fallback** — small hardcoded list, used if discovery fails

## Configuration

All defaults are sensible; you only need to change these to point at a
different upstream instance.

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `UPSTREAM_CHAT_URL` | `https://app.chatplayground.ai/api/chat/azure` | Azure chat endpoint; the `perplexity` / `lmsys` sibling URLs are derived from it |
| `UPSTREAM_ORIGIN` | `https://web.chatplayground.ai` | Forwarded as `Origin` |
| `UPSTREAM_REFERER` | `https://web.chatplayground.ai/` | Forwarded as `Referer` |
| `UPSTREAM_UPLOAD_URL` | `https://temp-file-host.chatplayground.ai/upload` | File upload endpoint |

Optional KV bindings:

| Binding | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `MODEL_CACHE` | Cross-isolate model registry cache (1 h TTL) |

## Caveats

1. **Tool calling uses a compatibility shim.** chatplayground's upstream chat
   endpoints do not expose native tool execution. The relay injects tool
   instructions, parses the model's structured call, and returns a standard
   `tool_calls` or Responses `function_call` item. Your application executes
   the tool and sends its result in the next request.
2. **No real usage counts.** chatplayground doesn't return token usage, so
   the `usage` field is estimated (chars ÷ 4). Don't bill on it.
3. **Brittle to upstream changes.** Any change to `/api/models` shape, endpoint
   path, or request shape may break the worker. Open an issue / PR.
4. **`/v1/files` is essentially anonymous.** chatplayground's upload
   endpoint accepts any caller (no auth), and our Bearer regex is a speed
   bump, not a gate. If you deploy publicly and care about your worker's
   request quota, add a size cap or remove the route.
5. **Keep your Clerk user ID private.** It grants access to your
   chatplayground account quota; treat it like an API key.
