# chatplayground-relay-worker

> OpenAI-compatible Cloudflare Worker that relays to [chatplayground.ai](https://web.chatplayground.ai/).
> BYOK, stateless, multi-model. Drop-in `base_url` for OpenAI SDKs, Chatbox, LangChain, etc.

## What it does

Wraps chatplayground.ai's internal chat endpoint as a standard OpenAI
`/v1/chat/completions` API, so any OpenAI-compatible client can use
chatplayground's chat models with your existing chatplayground account.

```
OpenAI SDK ──► Cloudflare Worker ──► chatplayground.ai
              (this repo)            (your account)
```

No keys stored, no chat history persisted, no database. Just a translator.

## Status: experimental

chatplayground.ai does not publish a public API. This worker reverse-engineers
their internal endpoints. The following will break it (degrade gracefully
where possible):

- chatplayground changes endpoint paths or request shape
- chatplayground tightens authentication on their internal endpoint
- chatplayground rotates the JS bundle in a way that breaks the model parser
  (falls back to a small SEED list on parse failure)

## Authentication: bring your own Clerk user ID

You provide your chatplayground Clerk user ID (looks like `user_xxxxxxxxxxxxx`)
as the OpenAI-style Bearer token. The worker forwards it to upstream as
`X-Clerk-User-Id`.

**How to find your Clerk user ID:**

1. Open <https://web.chatplayground.ai/> and sign in
2. Open DevTools → Network tab
3. Send any message in the UI
4. Find the request to `/api/chat/azure`
5. Copy the value of the `X-Clerk-User-Id` request header

> ⚠️ **Treat your Clerk user ID like an API key.**
> It grants access to your chatplayground account quota.
> Don't share it. Don't post your worker URL publicly without thinking.

## Features

| Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | Stream + non-stream; multimodal (`image_url` content parts) |
| `GET /v1/models` | Dynamic discovery from chatplayground's JS bundle, KV + memory cached |
| `POST /v1/files` | Image upload proxy → returns a URL usable as `image_url.url` |

| Not supported | Why |
|---|---|
| Tool / function calling | No upstream chat endpoint exposes tool use |
| `/v1/images/generations` | Upstream image-gen models live on a different endpoint |
| `/v1/embeddings` | Upstream doesn't expose embeddings |
| `/v1/audio/*` | Upstream doesn't expose audio |

### Chat models (auto-discovered)

chatplayground serves chat models from **three upstream endpoints**
(`azure` / `perplexity` / `lmsys`), routed by model `botId`. The relay mirrors
that routing automatically, so a single OpenAI `model` field reaches the right
one. It exposes **every chat-group model** in the bundle — including models
chatplayground marks `active:false` (hidden in their UI but still callable
upstream, e.g. perplexity `sonar-pro`).

Some commonly-available ids (call `GET /v1/models` for the live set):

| Model id (use this in `model` field) | Provider | Endpoint | Vision |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gpt-5.5` | openai | azure | ✅ |
| `gpt-5.4` | openai | azure | ✅ |
| `gemini-3-flash` | google | azure | ✅ |
| `claude-haiku-4-5` | anthropic | azure | ✅ |
| `deepseek-v4-pro` | deepseek | azure | — |
| `kimi-k2.6` | moonshot | azure | — |
| `perplexity-sonar-pro` | perplexity | perplexity | — |
| `llama-4-scout` | meta | lmsys | ✅ |

> Perplexity models return a structured citation list at the end of the
> stream. The relay strips that raw payload and re-emits the URLs as a
> Markdown `**Sources**` block; on the non-streaming path it also rewrites
> inline `[N]` markers as Markdown links so they render as clickable in
> OpenAI-compatible chat clients.

## Quick start

### Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/chatplayground-relay-worker
cd chatplayground-relay-worker
npm install
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:8787
```

### Deploy to Cloudflare

```bash
npm run deploy
# → https://chatplayground-relay.<your-account>.workers.dev
```

### Optional: KV-backed model cache

Without KV, model discovery falls back to a 5-minute per-isolate memory cache
plus a hardcoded SEED fallback list. That's fine for personal use. For shared
deployments you can add KV:

```bash
npx wrangler kv namespace create MODEL_CACHE
# Then uncomment the kv_namespaces block in wrangler.jsonc and paste the printed ID.
```

## Usage

### curl

```bash
export WORKER=https://chatplayground-relay.<acct>.workers.dev
export KEY=user_YOUR_CLERK_ID

# List models
curl -s $WORKER/v1/models -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" | jq

# Non-streaming chat
curl -s $WORKER/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"model":"gpt-5.5","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"say hi"}]}' | jq

# Streaming
curl -N $WORKER/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"model":"gemini-3-flash","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"count to 5"}],"stream":true}'
```

### OpenAI Python SDK

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://chatplayground-relay.<acct>.workers.dev/v1",
    api_key="user_YOUR_CLERK_ID",
)

# Text
resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-5.5",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is use-after-free?"}],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)

# Streaming
for chunk in client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-5.5",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Count to 5"}],
    stream=True,
):
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="", flush=True)

# Vision — upload via /v1/files, then reference
file = client.files.create(file=open("photo.jpg", "rb"), purpose="vision")
resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gemini-3-flash",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?"},
            {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": file.id}},
        ],
    }],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Chatbox / desktop clients

Add a custom OpenAI-compatible provider:

- **API host / base URL**: `https://chatplayground-relay.<acct>.workers.dev/v1`
- **API key**: your `user_xxxxxxxx` Clerk ID
- **Model**: any id from `GET /v1/models`

### Continuing a chatplayground-side conversation

Every API call defaults to a fresh chatplayground chat with `noSave: true` —
nothing shows up in your chatplayground.ai dashboard, and each request starts
a new conversation on the upstream side. The conversation still works because
OpenAI clients re-send the full `messages[]` array every turn.

Two opt-in extension fields let you change that:

| If you want | Add to request body |
|---|---|
| Save to chatplayground history | `"metadata": {"save": true}` |
| Continue a specific chatplayground chat | `"user": "<chatId>"` (CUID from a prior chatplayground session) |

Standard OpenAI SDKs don't surface these but you can hand-craft the request.

```

### Model discovery

`/v1/models` doesn't hardcode a list. Each request goes through:

1. **In-isolate memory cache** (5 min TTL) — hits if isolate is warm
2. **KV cache** (1 h TTL) — hits across isolates if `MODEL_CACHE` binding is configured
3. **Live discovery** — fetch `web.chatplayground.ai/`, regex out the current
   `assets/index-XXX.js` bundle hash, fetch the bundle, regex-extract model
   entries (`{botId, modelName, provider, group, active, supportImage}`),
   filter to `group:"chat"`. The `active` flag is **not** filtered on — it
   controls UI visibility only; inactive models are still callable upstream.
4. **SEED fallback** — small hardcoded list, used if discovery fails

The bundle hash rotates on every chatplayground deploy; the discovery flow
follows it automatically.

## Configuration

All defaults are sensible; you only need to change these to point at a
different upstream instance.

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `UPSTREAM_CHAT_URL` | `https://app.chatplayground.ai/api/chat/azure` | Azure chat endpoint; the `perplexity` / `lmsys` sibling URLs are derived from it |
| `UPSTREAM_ORIGIN` | `https://web.chatplayground.ai` | Forwarded as `Origin` |
| `UPSTREAM_REFERER` | `https://web.chatplayground.ai/` | Forwarded as `Referer` |
| `UPSTREAM_HOMEPAGE` | `https://web.chatplayground.ai/` | Scraped for current bundle URL |
| `UPSTREAM_UPLOAD_URL` | `https://temp-file-host.chatplayground.ai/upload` | File upload endpoint |

Optional KV bindings:

| Binding | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `MODEL_CACHE` | Cross-isolate model registry cache (1 h TTL) |

## Caveats

1. **No tool / function calling.** None of the upstream chat endpoints
   (`azure` / `perplexity` / `lmsys`) support it — live-tested: injected
   OpenAI `tools` are ignored and answered as prose, and a forced
   `tool_choice` returns a plain-text error, never a structured `tool_calls`
   reply. The relay also never forwards `tools` / `tool_choice` upstream.
2. **No real usage counts.** chatplayground doesn't return token usage, so
   the `usage` field is estimated (chars ÷ 4). Don't bill on it.
3. **Brittle to upstream changes.** Any change to bundle structure, endpoint
   path, or request shape may break the worker. Open an issue / PR.
4. **`/v1/files` is essentially anonymous.** chatplayground's upload
   endpoint accepts any caller (no auth), and our Bearer regex is a speed
   bump, not a gate. If you deploy publicly and care about your worker's
   request quota, add a size cap or remove the route.
5. **Keep your Clerk user ID private.** It grants access to your
   chatplayground account quota; treat it like an API key.
