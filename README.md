# chatplayground-relay-worker

> OpenAI-compatible Cloudflare Worker that relays to [chatplayground.ai](https://web.chatplayground.ai/).
> BYOK, stateless, multi-model. Drop-in `base_url` for OpenAI SDKs, Chatbox, LangChain, etc.

## What it does

Wraps chatplayground.ai's internal chat endpoint as a standard OpenAI
`/v1/chat/completions` API, so any OpenAI-compatible client can use
chatplayground's chat models with your existing chatplayground account.

```
OpenAI SDK ──► Cloudflare Worker ──► chatplayground.ai
              (this repo)            (your account)
```

No keys stored, no chat history persisted, no database. Just a translator.

## Status: experimental

chatplayground.ai does not publish a public API. This worker reverse-engineers
their internal endpoints. The following will break it (degrade gracefully
where possible):

- chatplayground changes endpoint paths or request shape
- chatplayground tightens authentication on their internal endpoint
- chatplayground changes the `/api/models` shape in a way that breaks discovery
  (`/v1/models` and chat then return 503 until it recovers)

## Authentication: bring your own Clerk session token

Upstream authenticates with a **Clerk session token** — a JWT you send as the
OpenAI-style Bearer token, forwarded verbatim as `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`.
(The old `X-Clerk-User-Id` header no longer works: `/api/chat/*` 401s on it.)

**How to find your session token:**

1. Open <https://web.chatplayground.ai/> and sign in
2. Open DevTools → Network tab
3. Send any message in the UI
4. Find the request to `/api/chat/azure`
5. Copy the `Authorization` header value (the `eyJ...` JWT)

> ⚠️ **These tokens expire 60 seconds after Clerk issues them.**
> A copy-pasted JWT is fine for one `curl`, useless for a long-lived client.
> For anything ongoing use gateway mode below, which mints a fresh token per
> request from a cookie that lasts months.

> ⚠️ **Treat the token like an API key.** It grants access to your
> chatplayground account quota for as long as it lives.

### Gateway mode (custom API key, auto-refreshing credential)

Because a session JWT dies in 60 seconds, it cannot be stored as a secret. What
*can* be stored is Clerk's `__client` cookie; the worker mints a fresh session
token from it exactly as the web app does (cached per isolate, refreshed 15s
before expiry). Set two secrets:

```bash
wrangler secret put CLERK_CLIENT_COOKIE  # value of the `__client` cookie
wrangler secret put RELAY_API_KEY        # a key you invent, e.g. sk-relay-xxxxx
```

**Where the cookie comes from:** DevTools → Application → Cookies →
`https://clerk.chatplayground.ai` → copy `__client`.

The session id is *not* configured. It cannot be decoded out of the cookie
(which holds only `id` + `rotating_token`), so the worker asks Clerk for it —
`GET /v1/client` → the active session, resolved once per isolate and cached
alongside the token. That also means a new session on the same client is picked
up on its own, where a pinned `sess_...` would have gone stale.

Once `RELAY_API_KEY` is set, callers authenticate with **that** key
(`Authorization: Bearer sk-relay-xxxxx`) and never see the real credential.
Unset it to fall back to passthrough. (Secrets, not `wrangler.jsonc` vars —
vars are plaintext.)

#### How long does the cookie last?

Ignore the expiry date the browser shows on it — that is the browser's own
`Expires` attribute, and the value you copied is a JWT with **no `exp` claim**:

```json
{ "id": "client_xxxxxxxx", "rotating_token": "r0cm2k7z..." }
```

Validity is decided server-side by Clerk's client record and that
`rotating_token`, so the cookie does not die of old age — it dies when Clerk
**rotates** it (sign-out, re-sign-in, handshake events). Minting session tokens
does not rotate it; that was checked against the live API.

When Clerk *does* rotate, it returns the replacement in `Set-Cookie`, and the
worker writes it to KV (`clerk:client_cookie`) so the next isolate uses the live
value instead of the dead secret. **That survival depends on the `MODEL_CACHE`
KV binding being enabled** — see [KV-backed model cache](#kv-backed-model-cache).
Without it, a rotation means gateway mode 401s until you re-capture the cookie
by hand. A stale KV copy is self-healing: it's dropped and the secret retried
once, so re-running `wrangler secret put CLERK_CLIENT_COOKIE` always takes
effect.

## Features

| Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | Stream + non-stream; multimodal (`image_url` content parts) |
| `GET /v1/models` | Dynamic discovery from chatplayground's `/api/models`, KV + memory cached; `premiumOnly` models hidden unless `PREMIUM_MODELS="true"` |
| `POST /v1/files` | Image upload proxy → returns a URL usable as `image_url.url` |

| Not supported | Why |
|---|---|
| Tool / function calling | No upstream chat endpoint exposes tool use |
| `/v1/images/generations` | Upstream image-gen models live on a different endpoint |
| `/v1/embeddings` | Upstream doesn't expose embeddings |
| `/v1/audio/*` | Upstream doesn't expose audio |

### Chat models (auto-discovered)

chatplayground serves chat models from **three upstream endpoints**
(`azure` / `perplexity` / `lmsys`), routed by model `botId`. The relay mirrors
that routing automatically, so a single OpenAI `model` field reaches the right
one. Models chatplayground marks `active:false` are still exposed — that flag
is UI visibility only, and inactive models remain callable upstream.

Models the feed marks `premiumOnly` are **hidden from `GET /v1/models` by
default**, because upstream returns 403 for them without a premium plan; set
`PREMIUM_MODELS="true"` to list them anyway. Everything else is shown,
including the three models flagged `lifetimeOnly` — see the caveats for what
that flag is and isn't known to do. Hidden models stay callable either way:
the filter only changes what the relay advertises, and upstream remains the
thing that enforces access.

Snapshot of the feed (call `GET /v1/models` for the live set):

| Model id (use this in `model` field) | Provider | Endpoint | Vision | Access |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gpt-5.6-terra` | openai | azure | ✅ | — |
| `gpt-5.6-luna` | openai | azure | ✅ | — |
| `mistral-large-3` | mistral | azure | ✅ | — |
| `deepseek-v4-pro` | deepseek | azure | — | — |
| `deepseek-v4-flash` | deepseek | azure | — | — |
| `deepseek-r1` | deepseek | azure | — | — |
| `llama-4-scout` | meta | lmsys | ✅ | — |
| `llama-4-maverick` | meta | lmsys | ✅ | — |
| `grok-4.5` | xai | lmsys | ✅ | — |
| `qwen3.7-plus` | qwen | lmsys | ✅ | — |
| `minimax-m3` | minimax | lmsys | ✅ | — |
| `command-a` | cohere | lmsys | ✅ | — |
| `perplexity-sonar` | perplexity | perplexity | ✅ | — |
| `claude-sonnet-4-6` | anthropic | azure | ✅ | lifetime |
| `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` | google | azure | ✅ | lifetime |
| `kimi-k2.6` | kimi | azure | ✅ | lifetime |
| `claude-opus-5` | anthropic | azure | ✅ | premium |
| `claude-sonnet-5` | anthropic | azure | ✅ | premium |
| `gpt-5.6-sol` | openai | azure | ✅ | premium |
| `gemini-3.1-pro` | google | azure | ✅ | premium |
| `grok-4.6` | xai | lmsys | ✅ | premium |
| `perplexity-sonar-pro` | perplexity | perplexity | ✅ | premium |

`lifetime` = the feed's `lifetimeOnly` flag; those need a lifetime plan but
are **not** `premiumOnly`, so they are listed by default. Truncated — the feed
carried 33 chat models when this was written, 12 of them `premiumOnly`.

> Perplexity models return a structured citation list at the end of the
> stream. The relay strips that raw payload and re-emits the URLs as a
> Markdown `**Sources**` block; on the non-streaming path it also rewrites
> inline `[N]` markers as Markdown links so they render as clickable in
> OpenAI-compatible chat clients.

## Quick start

### Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/chatplayground-relay-worker
cd chatplayground-relay-worker
npm install
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:8787
```

No secrets are needed to run it: auth is BYOK, the caller supplies the session
token. Copy `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars` only if you want to point local dev
at a different upstream.

### Deploy to Cloudflare

```bash
npx wrangler login     # opens a browser; needed once per machine
npm run deploy
# → https://chatplayground-relay.<your-account>.workers.dev
```

Then smoke-test it — this is the fastest way to tell a broken deploy from a
broken upstream:

```bash
curl -s https://chatplayground-relay.<acct>.workers.dev/v1/models \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJYOUR.SESSION.JWT" | jq '.data | length'
```

A number is a working deploy. `503 model_discovery_failed` means the worker is
up but couldn't reach the upstream feed. `401` means the Bearer token isn't a
well-formed JWT.

Two optional follow-ups, in the order they usually matter:

**Gateway mode** — if anyone but you will call it, set the two secrets from
[gateway mode](#gateway-mode-custom-api-key-auto-refreshing-credential) so
callers get a stable key and the credential refreshes itself.

**`PREMIUM_MODELS`** — leave it unset unless the account has premium; see
[Configuration](#configuration).

### KV-backed model cache

The `MODEL_CACHE` namespace does double duty: the model registry, and the
rotated `__client` cookie in gateway mode. There is no hardcoded fallback list,
so without KV a discovery failure is a 503, every cold isolate refetches the
feed, and a Clerk cookie rotation has to be repaired by hand. A single-user
deploy survives that fine; gateway mode and anything shared should add KV:

```bash
npx wrangler kv namespace create MODEL_CACHE
# Then uncomment the kv_namespaces block in wrangler.jsonc and paste the printed ID.
```

## Usage

### curl

```bash
export WORKER=https://chatplayground-relay.<acct>.workers.dev
export KEY=eyJYOUR.SESSION.JWT

# List models
curl -s $WORKER/v1/models -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" | jq

# Non-streaming chat
curl -s $WORKER/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"model":"gpt-5.6-luna","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"say hi"}]}' | jq

# Streaming
curl -N $WORKER/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"model":"deepseek-v4-flash","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"count to 5"}],"stream":true}'
```

### OpenAI Python SDK

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://chatplayground-relay.<acct>.workers.dev/v1",
    api_key="eyJYOUR.SESSION.JWT",
)

# Text
resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-5.6-luna",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is use-after-free?"}],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)

# Streaming
for chunk in client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-5.6-luna",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Count to 5"}],
    stream=True,
):
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="", flush=True)

# Vision — upload via /v1/files, then reference
file = client.files.create(file=open("photo.jpg", "rb"), purpose="vision")
resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="llama-4-scout",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?"},
            {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": file.id}},
        ],
    }],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Chatbox / desktop clients

Add a custom OpenAI-compatible provider:

- **API host / base URL**: `https://chatplayground-relay.<acct>.workers.dev/v1`
- **API key**: your Clerk session JWT (or the gateway key)
- **Model**: any id from `GET /v1/models`

### Continuing a chatplayground-side conversation

Every API call defaults to a fresh chatplayground chat with `noSave: true` —
nothing shows up in your chatplayground.ai dashboard, and each request starts
a new conversation on the upstream side. The conversation still works because
OpenAI clients re-send the full `messages[]` array every turn.

Two opt-in extension fields let you change that:

| If you want | Add to request body |
|---|---|
| Save to chatplayground history | `"metadata": {"save": true}` |
| Continue a specific chatplayground chat | `"user": "<chatId>"` (CUID from a prior chatplayground session) |

Standard OpenAI SDKs don't surface these but you can hand-craft the request.

### Model discovery

`/v1/models` doesn't hardcode a list. Each request goes through:

1. **In-isolate memory cache** (5 min TTL) — hits if isolate is warm
2. **KV cache** (1 h TTL) — hits across isolates if `MODEL_CACHE` binding is configured
   (the same namespace also holds the rotated Clerk cookie under `clerk:client_cookie`)
3. **Live discovery** — `GET app.chatplayground.ai/api/models` (public JSON,
   no auth), validate each entry (`{botId, modelName, provider, group,
   endpoint, active, premiumOnly}`), keep `group:"chat"`. The `active` flag is
   **not** filtered on — it controls UI visibility only; inactive models are
   still callable upstream. Each entry's `endpoint` field decides which of the
   three `/api/chat/*` upstreams serves it.
If all three miss, the request fails with **503** `model_discovery_failed`.
There is deliberately no hardcoded fallback list: it would be a copy of data
that lives upstream, so it rots unnoticed and only gets used on the day
discovery is already broken — and serving it turned "discovery is down" into a
404 `model_not_found`, which tells callers a model doesn't exist when it does.

`/api/models` is fetched **without** credentials: it is a public catalogue and
returns the same bytes with or without one. Upstream ships the raw flags and
lets its own frontend filter, so there is no per-account entitlement to query —
which is why `PREMIUM_MODELS` is something you set rather than something the
relay works out. Access is only observable by making a chat call and reading
the 403, and a model listing shouldn't spend credits to find out.

The registry cached at every layer is the **full** list. `premiumOnly` is
filtered at read time in the `/v1/models` handler, so flipping
`PREMIUM_MODELS` takes effect immediately rather than waiting out the 1 h KV
TTL. Note the gate is `premiumOnly`, not the feed's `tier` field:
`gemini-3.7-flash` is `tier:"basic"` and still 403s without premium.

## Configuration

All defaults are sensible; you only need to change these to point at a
different upstream instance.

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `UPSTREAM_CHAT_URL` | `https://app.chatplayground.ai/api/chat/azure` | Azure chat endpoint; the `perplexity` / `lmsys` sibling URLs are derived from it |
| `UPSTREAM_ORIGIN` | `https://web.chatplayground.ai` | Forwarded as `Origin` |
| `UPSTREAM_REFERER` | `https://web.chatplayground.ai/` | Forwarded as `Referer` |
| `UPSTREAM_UPLOAD_URL` | `https://temp-file-host.chatplayground.ai/upload` | File upload endpoint |
| `PREMIUM_MODELS` | unset | `"true"` lists `premiumOnly` models in `GET /v1/models`. Leave unset unless the account has premium — upstream 403s them otherwise. Any other value counts as off |

Optional KV bindings:

| Binding | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `MODEL_CACHE` | Cross-isolate model registry cache (1 h TTL) |

## Caveats

1. **No tool / function calling.** None of the upstream chat endpoints
   (`azure` / `perplexity` / `lmsys`) support it — live-tested: injected
   OpenAI `tools` are ignored and answered as prose, and a forced
   `tool_choice` returns a plain-text error, never a structured `tool_calls`
   reply. The relay also never forwards `tools` / `tool_choice` upstream.
2. **No real usage counts.** chatplayground doesn't return token usage, so
   the `usage` field is estimated (chars ÷ 4). Don't bill on it.
3. **Premium models 403 on a non-premium account.** The feed marks 12 of its
   33 chat models `premiumOnly`; upstream rejects those unless the account has
   premium. They're hidden from `GET /v1/models` by default but stay callable,
   so a hardcoded id returns HTTP 403 `upstream_403` and upstream's own wording:

   > This model is only available to active subscribers.

   Note it says **active subscriber**, not "premium" or "advanced" — quote that
   line at support rather than describing the symptom, it names their field.

   The gate is `premiumOnly`, and not the feed's `tier` field:
   `gemini-3.7-flash` is `tier:"basic"` and 403s anyway. All 33 chat models
   were called once to establish this — every `premiumOnly:true` model was
   rejected and every reachable `premiumOnly:false` one succeeded, no
   exceptions. `creditWeight` is not the gate either (weight 7 succeeded while
   weight 2 was rejected). Re-derive none of this from the flag names; the
   feed's `active` flag, for instance, is enforced nowhere.
4. **Upstream rate-limits bursts.** A run of back-to-back chat calls starts
   returning `429 You're sending prompts too quickly`, with no `Retry-After`
   header to pace against. The relay passes 429 through unchanged so the
   client's own rate-limit backoff handles it.
5. **`lifetimeOnly` is an unresolved flag.** Three models carry it
   (`claude-sonnet-4-6`, `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`, `kimi-k2.6`). Only one was
   ever tested, on one paid account, and it worked — which cannot distinguish
   a real entitlement gate from a UI badge, the way `active` is one. It is
   also not established that the flag refers to the same product as any given
   "lifetime" plan. The relay does not read it: all three are
   `premiumOnly:false`, so they are listed regardless of what it means.
6. **Brittle to upstream changes.** Any change to `/api/models` shape, endpoint
   path, or request shape may break the worker. Open an issue / PR.
7. **`/v1/files` is essentially anonymous.** chatplayground's upload
   endpoint accepts any caller (no auth), and our Bearer regex is a speed
   bump, not a gate. If you deploy publicly and care about your worker's
   request quota, add a size cap or remove the route.
8. **Keep your session token and `__client` cookie private.** They grant access to your
   chatplayground account quota; treat it like an API key.
